# Patient Flows Sankey
## Patient flow analysis with a Sankey diagram

Using Plotly

###Overview 
This project is about modeling patient flows between units of a hospital using a Sankey diagram. Sankey diagrams are flow diagrams, in which the width of the links is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. Sankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on transfers or flows within a system. This diagram illustrates the complexity of patient flows between various units of a large hospital. 

By improving patient flow, a hospital can save money on staffing, decrease wait times and boost patient and provider satisfaction.
